== Development

NOTE: The first build will be slow due to the installation of NPM in your user directory under .microprofile

To build and run the application in its own TomEE instance:

----
$ mvn clean package tomee:run -pl :web-application -DskipTests
----

To make TomEE pick up changes to any static resources, typescript files, templates or style sheets:

----
$ cd web-application
$ mvn frontend:gulp
----

Hint: Create a run configuration in your IDE for each of the above.
